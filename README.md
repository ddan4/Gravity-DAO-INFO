# Four Structures 

\**This is a working document to sort our organizational resources into the following categories.*

Gravitation can be described as a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy‚Äîincluding planets, stars, galaxies, and even light‚Äîare brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another.

Newton says that "all bodies whatsoever are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation" by which "all bodies must mutually gravitate towards one another."

From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity
