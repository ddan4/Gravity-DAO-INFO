  > Many educational theorists believe that learning is context-dependent. In other words, the nature of a student’s learning depends on the context in which the learning takes place. From this perspective, authentic activities—or learning activities that re-create as closely as possible the key dynamics and challenges of real-world activities—are critical to making learning relevant.

  > But what does it mean to make a negotiation exercise “authentic”? One approach is to select exercises in which the parties, issues, and factual contexts replicate as closely as possible the negotiations with which participants are familiar. This is most easily done with a relatively homogenous participant group-for instance, litigation attorneys, middle-school teachers, environmental activists, financial services sales representatives, or congressional representatives—who are likely to share some common negotiation experiences.\

  > In the January 2013 issue of Negotiation Journal, George Mason University professor Daniel Druckman and Creighton University Law School professor Noam Ebner discuss the benefits and drawbacks of simulations as a learning tool. Reviewing social science research, they find that engaging in simulations improves students’ motivation and retention of key concepts that have already been taught in lectures and classroom discussions. Thus, classes that combine simulations with more traditional classroom methods may maximize learning.\
