# Divided \ Unified Thinking

If you take a look back at the stroke Myro of insight, which I mentioned about the unified and divided ways that the, the human brain thinks what you can see is that a lot of times we have these unified and divided ways of thinking. 

If a person is approaching things from a divided standpoint, they're going to tend to have a conflict in when they find themselves in context of a unified system in the, in the spiral, this could be roughly connected to the eye and the we, and as I said, previously, as we evolve along the spiral, you can see how this conflict actually pushes you to evolve.  

That actually will be talked about with some of the other theories of conflict that we have about conflict transformation, which is something that Juan will go into quite a lot in later sessions of this training. 

In any case, I, we mostly put this in here. I did a whole talk about decolonization concerned with figuring out how to take the divided and contextualize it within the unified.

I have on the left a link to the PowerPoint, which talks about this extensively with respect to the unified and divided and a video that goes through about two thirds of the slides in that. 

Part of the thing to understand about the different ways of thinking, and to be able to contextualize it in terms of your evolution, in terms of where people are finding themselves here, contextualize it in terms of how an individual might be found in the spiral, how a person's feelings and needs and ability to make good requests and ability to make good observations is impacted by their own divided in unified thinking. 

### More on Divided\Unified

(00:53:31)
**Juan Carlos**:    I want participate. Add something to the difference between divided and unified thinking and unified thinking is based on understanding that there is no difference between the world we see, and our inner self that's true. When you see the other person, as same as yourself, you won't be able to treat that person badly because you are, you are treating yourself badly. It's the same. 

If you have bad communication with yourself, you will have a bad communication with the other one. The key point of unified and divided thinking is to understand that the world we see is, is a reflection of our inner self. 

It's a reflection of our needs of our, of our state of mind. We should have compassion for the other and for ourselves, because the way we talk to the other persons are, is the same way that we talk to ourselves.  

We need to be very careful with the words we use to communicate. I would love to see the, the explanation that is in the next slide about that, because when you understand that, right and left are just like both ends of the same thing. When you are in the right, you can push to the left. When you are in the left, you can push to the right. That way you can like, overcome the dualities that you see in the world, by the unification of your, of the way you see the thing  

(00:55:28)
**Durgadas**:    That's right now, there's a metaphor that I would use around exactly what he was saying with regard to, what do we consider to be ourselves. So, for example, it's very simple. Sometimes when you go up to scratch your head, you might accidentally poke yourself in the eye.

Everyone's done a dumb thing like that, where you go to do something and you stub your toe, because there wasn't enough mindfulness around what's going on, but nobody would sit there and yell at their finger for poking themselves in the eye As though it were some separate entity because you believe your finger to be a part of your self. 

That is an example of unified thinking. I'm suggesting that if, if suddenly you find somebody poking you in the eye about something, or having a problem with you, or accusing you of something, or, or rather than yelling at your own finger to instead realize that your, your intention is to consider that thing to be a part of yourself.  

Instead of being mad at it, or to create all of this stuff, all of the nonviolent communication framework, all of the spar dynamics thing is to give you ways in which you can find an approach that will make it so that you would imagine that the person or the system or the structure, or the leadership or whatever it is, would be considered to be a part of yourself. 

That's the point of all of this, right? And so there are a lot of ways to do this. All of this talking is really just trying to find different ways that might re resonate with the individuals on the call to give themselves the validation that they need to adopt this unified way of thinking for themselves.

## Tuning Into The Unified

> Unified thinking is based on the understanding that there is no difference between the world we see and our inner self. And that duality comes from within our mind. “The world appears to you, as your mind is.”

> This graphic illustrates the underlying principles of the mind which creates the duality or Maya, called Gunas.

> With understanding, self-compassion and detachment we can turn the various strategies of abuse into health.

The final slide here is, is from the Hindu architecture of the mind. I actually talk about this in two of the slides. One is that this is both the architecture of a mistake, and it is the architecture of a solution. 

The way the mind is described in Hindu thinking is that oftentimes when we're caught up in divided thinking, we have almost like those old clocks with the swinging pendulum going back and forth between the veiling part of the mind, the shadow aspect to denied self things that you're denying that are going on. and also swinging over to the projecting part of the mind.  

There's another way you can think about this in terms of likes and dislikes. Now this, this pendulum swinging back and forth between the, the veian projecting power of the mine is called Vic shepa or the tossing of the mine. 

What we're trying to do here in the gravity training is to give you tools and techniques to overcome this, and gradually move the mind toward the so peak way of thinking. 

Now, if you take a look at the Jill Bolty Taylor, Ted talk, one of the things that you'll see is that she talks about the left and the right brain, the divided in the, in the unified, the divide way of thinking really in this situation is the Rajasic and the Tamasic, the projecting power of the mind, the veiling power of the mind, it's all the left brain.  

The side effect part of the mind is the right brain. That's only thinking about now. As you're you progress along your path of understanding and self-compassion and inclusion, there are some side effects. Dispassion is one of them, and it's incredibly, you can actually use dispassion to grow your progress along this upward trajectory. 

Then there's a couple of links in here. Also talking about the una, which is what these are called. Rogers and Thomas are the Gunas and my friend, Dr. Mark, mark Halpern, he's the head of the American college of Veta in nav university, where I used to live ashram is right next to that. The whole idea behind unified thinking is this is actually the way unified thinking can be created. and when I lived in the ashram, we, it had an effect.  

We were taught certain modes of thinking that were more sodic. We were taught modes of eating modes of conducting standpoint also is going toward this sodic way of thinking and this detachment and self-compassion that you can use to break the cycle of going back and forth with this tossing of the mind is, is crucial in how we work as gravitons and people who are trying to resolve conflict. So, are there any questions about this, or Juan, did you wanna add anything to this? I know you really liked this particular slide, so I'd like to hear what you would say about it.  

(01:02:18)
**Juan Carlos**:    Yes. That I read this amazing book that is called Kybalion, and it has 7 principles that are, are very related to this picture. It says all this mind, the universe is mental. As above, below, as below so above. 

This principle embodies the truth, that there is always a correspondence between the laws and phenomena of the virus, of being like nothing, everything moves, everything vibrates, everything is dual and everything has poles. 

Everything has a polar opposite, but, and unlike, and the same that are unlike and the same opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree extremes, meat. Then it says everything flows out and in everything is at, it has its tides. Then it says every cost has its effect. 

Every effect has its cost. What, what I am trying to, to say with this is that there is this state of mind where if you see it from a unified point of view, you will be able to use duality against itself. 

(01:04:10)
**Durgadas**:    Well, so what I'd like you to observe in the macro sense is everything that you see here, all of this explanatory stuff, all of these mental models, these are all exactly similar to what used to be called mythologies. 

Mythologies are not just stories. Mythologies are stories, which they root to them that are, that have complex interlocking relationship based complexities to them. Just like this spiral and mythology actually is intended to introduce the person who's observing them to various approaches that one could, you could see the spiral in multiple different ways. 

It provides about the different ways you can assess the spiral. Mythology is identical to this. Previous mythologies used to be used as a unified framework for imparting vast complex and contextual understandings for multiple levels of learner development and maturity levels along the pathologist of all the roles in individual plays.  

This is an extremely important conceptual framework. The point of it, of having all these mythologies is exactly what Juan just said, which is to use duality against itself to create a unification. Now what this actually does is, and if you talk to subnet a little bit about my discussions with her and with Fabio, the primary thing that we're talking about Fabio and I all the time is how to use duality against itself. 

Now, if you're talking about things in terms of conflict resolution, we're basically doing exactly that for everything. Everything that we're doing here around the conflict resolution cycle is to clarify a person's feelings. 

If they don't know what their feelings are to clarify a person's needs, if they don't know what they are, if clarify, whether a person's making a request or demand, if they don't know when, when they're doing that, or when they're not to clarify when the observa making an observation or making a judgment, that's going to disconnect them or create more conflict.  

If you misidentify your feelings, that's gonna create more conflict because you're gonna be caught up in your head rather than to have any sense of where you actually are. All of the understandings that we come up with use the, the duality and the ignorance and the projections against themselves to create this SOIC way of being in and feeling and thinking. 

Right? so yeah, I, the using duality against itself is, is like the hidden agenda underneath all of these different things, right? Because what we're trying to do is create this unified approach, you know? And so I hope that clarifies that, and this, Hindu approach, I've got some links on the, on the other side to, to help understand how all of that works. This is not exactly related to token engineering, but, but this first thing is just all about how to contextualize all of our future work, so that we have an understanding of the real meaning behind what this conflict resolution slash transformation can actually create.
