# Welfare at Work in Web3 - 2

(00:59)    
**Speaker 0**:    Hello everybody here.  

(01:01)    
**Speaker 1**:    Oh, Hey, he changed profile.  

(01:06)    
**Speaker 0**:    Can you? Yeah. Awesome. We are getting people in.  

(01:14)    
**Speaker 1**:    Cool. Yeah, I'll send it to you.  

(01:37)    
**Speaker 3**:    Okay. Speaker. Let's wait for bill. Sorry for these guys.  

(02:05)    
**Speaker 1**:    All good happens.  

(02:18)    
**Speaker 3**:    Let's try to send invitations again.  

(02:31)    
**Speaker 0**:    Bill, do you see the invitation?  

(02:56)    
**Speaker 3**:    Okay. I can see the invitation in my list that has been sent. It's really strange.  

(03:16)    
**Speaker 0**:    I wonder if there is a profile setting that doesn't allow you to speak?  

(03:22)    
**Speaker 3**:    Oh, maybe the mic is deactivated. I had to do that yesterday. Bill, if you don't receive anything, maybe go into the settings and allow your mic. If you haven't again, Patrick, 

(03:48)    
**Speaker 0**:    Maybe it's a setting technical  

(03:51)    
**Speaker 3**:    Yesterday had the same problem to go in settings and allow Twitter to access the microphone  

(04:01)    
**Speaker 0**:    Makes sense.  

(04:04)    
**Speaker 1**:    Hmm. That's a good point. Me and PK were in a space, last week or the week before. He was able to speak. Okay.  

(04:14)    
**Speaker 3**:    That's strange.  

(04:18)    
**Speaker 1**:    I almost feel like it's like country based some reason, but I, you guys are in Europe. Italy. I'm in the UK. I'm able to be a speaker. I dunno.  

(04:43)    
**Speaker 3**:    That sounds strange.  

(04:49)    
**Speaker 0**:    Brazil, how does that  

(04:58)    
**Speaker 3**:    Having no luck has try to anything that would prevent me from connecting a mic, but anyway, we can, start until we fix this. Maybe Bianca, if you wanna start with first question, I try to fix this problem and in the background.  

(05:46)    
**Speaker 0**:    Yeah, sure. I'm sorry. We like lack this space. Jake, did you introduce yourself? Do you wanna go? I  

(06:02)    
**Speaker 1**:    Did.  

(06:04)    
**Speaker 0**:    Okay. Maybe if we can just do the question that go  

(06:08)    
**Speaker 1**:    Again.  

(06:09)    
**Speaker 0**:    The question that we prepared for you that we are interested in is many people in DAOs work without most of the benefits that traditional corporations can offer. What's the interest that DAO can have. What's your vision for future of work in Web Three?  

(06:37)    
**Speaker 3**:    Your mic was a bit, so the question is what the DAO can have offer better benefits and better safety to contributors and yeah. What's the vision for the future of working website.  

(06:57)    
**Speaker 1**:    Awesome. The, can you guys hear me? Yeah.  

(07:02)    
**Speaker 3**:    Yes.  

(07:04)    
**Speaker 1**:    Cool. A big thing for us at work though, is we don't just wanna stop at what is the required benefits for each jurisdiction. We wanna offer way more than that. We wanna like the sky is the limit when it comes to benefits. What we're even talking to companies such as Headspace and they offer it's like a meditation app, which is a mental health side of things. It's really about offering, not just what is expected, but more than that. Because we think to attract the best talent and keep the best talent in this space, we need to really go the extra mile and offer more than what people might be used to or might be expecting. Right. To that's what I'd say.  

(08:06)    
**Speaker 3**:    How does the future look like? Like they say, DAO are the way work will, will be organized in the 21st century. What can we expect from the future of work?  

(08:25)    
**Speaker 1**:    People can, it's a lot of this is collaborative. We're not necessarily here to say this is what it should be.. We're very open to hearing what people want as well. The main thing, what you'll see in the future is more personalized benefits for contributors. More specific to the jurisdiction they're in as well. Like we are partnering with benefits, brokers in different jurisdictions so that we can offer not only what they tell us is required, but more than that we speak to benefit brokers so that we can get the best of the benefits for people and not just what is compliant. The future is a lot of it is unknown, but I said, we are looking at new benefits that aren't necessarily commonplace in Web two companies and traditional working places and also benefits that can be adapted to Web Three. Right. Because not everybody is, it's not like your traditional companies where everyone's in the same place and you can go out and do like work team things together or whatever. It's very much needs to be adapted for the Web Three. Right.  

(10:03)    
**Speaker 3**:    When DAO come to why we wait until somebody managed to fix the problem that we have with bill and Patrick, the DAO come to work down the contributors. What they're looking for specifically the DAO, I'm curious.  

(10:25)    
**Speaker 5**:    Oh, I'm finally in like 15 minutes, it was a basically Twitter spaces. Doesn't work with the desktop Twitter. You have to use it on your phone.  

(10:43)    
**Speaker 3**:    Oh God. If I knew that. Yes, of course. I didn't know. You were trying through your laptop. That was the problem. Even for Patrick use your phone. Definitely. Bill, would you like to introduce yourself who you are, what you do and why you do it? Yeah. The way you do it.  

(11:05)    
**Speaker 5**:    Of course. I'm bill, I've been in the DAO space since 2018, first building DAO platforms. Building technologies to allow people to form DAOs more easily and then joined Opolis about a year ago. Opolis is a lot like work Dell. Their focus is on a slightly different customer. We provide payroll compliance benefits and the ability to get paid and pay yourself in crypto for freelancers and Web Three contributors. We're worked out their customer is the DAO or the crypto company. Our customer tends to be the individuals that work for one or many DAOs or work for many clients in the crypto Web Three space, but the missions and like the goal is pretty shared where it's all about getting people, especially in this Web Three space access to high quality benefits, access to payroll compliance, make their life easier, make it comfortable to work in Web Three for folks so that they can have the benefits and experience of working for a big company while actually working for some internet native organization or a cutting edge startup.  

(12:38)    
**Speaker 5**:    That's what we do. I'm on the product side. Like Jake thinking about what better benefits can we get folks, what can we do to improve the experience of being like a crypto native freelancer? What integrations can we offer so that the freelancers that join Opus really have like a commercial command center at their fingertips and can manage their work life from a single place.  

(13:19)    
**Speaker 3**:    Thanks bill. Thanks. We have Patrick as well. Did you have same problem where you were you trying to connect through your laptop?  

(13:29)    
**Speaker 5**:    Yep.  

(13:30)    
**Speaker 6**:    Yep. Shout out to bill for it. Support  

(13:35)    
**Speaker 3**:    Less alert, Patrick. I would like to introduce yourself as well.  

(13:42)    
**Speaker 6**:    I'm the head of growth for part of the biz dev team at worked out. Jake pretty much summed it up well for what we're doing in the space. Build on the very well is very good as well in terms of our synergies and how we're really approaching the market. Just a couple things that we do on our side since we do have a couple models, is we do offer since we act as employers for on behalf of these pure dos that I know we'll get into later for these contributors that want some real world benefits the whole world isn't doubted yet. There is still certain obligations that need to be helped. I know bill mentioned this, but visa support visa sponsorship is a huge one having the necessary paperwork for even things like mortgage loans. Even sometimes depending on where you are, if you want to even start renting apartment. On the payroll side, we do also figure out RTUs and RTA investing contracts, which is pretty exciting for us.  

(15:00)    
**Speaker 3**:    Thanks, Patrick. Let's start digging deep in what you do. First question, I would like to ask to jail for work DAO. I read white paper, I checked, I searched for information on what you do. In Web paper you make as a Patrick introduced before distinction between pure DAO and limited liability DAO from contributors point of view. What's the difference? Could you explain that to our audience?  

(15:36)    
**Speaker 1**:    Yeah, sure. I actually think PK would be better off tackling this particular question if you wouldn't mind.  

(15:43)    
**Speaker 3**:    No problem.  

(15:45)    
**Speaker 1**:    Awesome.  

(15:46)    
**Speaker 6**:    Yeah, I can take it on. From the contributors perspective, bill can definitely also chime in here as well since he's on the legal side of it, but you're looking at pure dials that have zero legal entities, so they're not they have no, they have no legal wrap around them at all. Whereas at least with the liability wrapped outs they can, they're actually legal, legally recognized entities depending on where they form it. Regardless, if you have, from a contributor's perspective, you gotta look at if you're gonna be a contractor, not for benefits, but let's say for payroll in fear in France or Spain, Germany, a lot of European countries have V a T tax that needs to be invoiced. Who do you invoice that to? You're gonna have to invoice that to a legal entity and pure DAO don't have that.  

(16:42)    
**Speaker 6**:    You just have, you have to take, you have to just look at and assess how much risk you're willing to take as a contributor getting paid from that DAO and how much risk the DAO is willing to take when they're paying out contributors or when something goes wrong in their treasury, or if they did a token swab and something goes wrong, how much risk are they willing to take? That those are the huge distinctions that you have to look at from the contributors perspective when you engage with pure DAO versus THS that have liability rappers. That's why one of the things that we do is one of the biggest things that we do and build, does build for the contributor's perspective for Opolis is they're able to actually wrap the individual. That way they have that piece of mind with engaging with different THWs cuz let's face it.  

(17:33)    
**Speaker 6**:    A lot of DAOs sometimes could be anonymous. Wonderland could be is a very good example to where there's some stuff that went down there and people didn't know cuz the CFO was anonymous. They found out that his past history could really affect the individual contributors from our perspective, if we were able to act as that legal entity for that DAO, then both contributors and the DAO, both sides are, safe, you know? Tho those are the ways we look at it from both contributor perspective and the DAO perspective.  

(18:22)    
**Speaker 3**:    As you said before, what you do is basically you hire the contributors on behalf of the DAO, am I right?  

(18:31)    
**Speaker 6**:    Correct.  

(18:32)    
**Speaker 3**:    And then contributors can work for different dos through you. No, 

(18:40)    
**Speaker 6**:    Yes. That's so the one distinction there is that is also gonna come down to the DAO that we are working with. We might be employing them on paper and acting as the employer, but we have no say over the contributors, if the DAO lets you be autonomous and lets you work in different projects while you're being employed by them, then all the more power go ahead. In terms of us being that factor or giving that say, it's not up to us, that's up to DAO.  

(19:25)    
**Speaker 3**:    I see you're talking, but I can't hear you.  

(19:32)    
**Speaker 6**:    Can you hear me now?  

(19:33)    
**Speaker 3**:     

(19:35)    
**Speaker 6**:    Okay. Did you miss the whole part?  

(19:37)    
**Speaker 3**:    No. Just you, so  

(19:57)    
**Speaker 5**:    Yeah, I can follow onto what Patrick said. He's right. That there's like a big difference in risk profile between DAO with a legal entity for legal rapper and DAO without and that's where from the side, we've tried to make that risk, not matter to folks at all by just saying, okay, wrap yourself as a contributor in an LLCs core, this is us specific. This model works in the us and Canada, but essentially wrap yourself in an LLC S Corp professionalize yourself and then invoice the DAO just as you would invoice any client you would have as a freelancer. That means you can invoice one DAO. If you just do all of your work for one DAO, you can also easily invoice multiple DAOs have multiple projects that you're working for because you are, you're employed by the business that you own in our case rather than the DAO or your clients.  

(21:15)    
**Speaker 5**:    It allows our model really allows DAO to be ethereal and internet native and not have to worry as much about incorporation or legal entities by pushing the legal entity to the contributor level that not to say that's right for all DAOs or I'm not given legal advice, but just our philosophy has been, let DAOs be DAOs, but so that you can like connect the DAO world to the meat space, professionalize yourself, wrap yourself in an entity, build the dowels like you would bill any other client with like do proper tax withholding, do all of that because at the end of the day tax authorities, probably aren't going to try and bother going after like amorphous internet organizations that are global. They care about whether they get paid by the individuals who live in their countries and that's where we're focused on those individual contributors and giving them the liability protection as well as the tax compliance and benefits that they need to work for whoever they want without necessarily worrying about the entity status of the DAO or the organization or whatnot.  

(22:44)    
**Speaker 5**:    Unfortunately, I have to drop for a developer stand up, but yeah, this was sorry for the technical issues and joining so late, but the couple of questions were really good and it was nice to be on here with some of the work DAO folks that are doing some really cool stuff alongside what we're doing in the space.  

(23:11)    
**Speaker 6**:    Bill, I'll try to answer the questions as minded as  

(23:19)    
**Speaker 5**:    Possible. Unfortunately I've gotta jump to this onboarding meeting that's or wait. Yeah, no, I still have to jump to it. Okay.  

(23:37)    
**Speaker 3**:    Thanks for being here.  

(23:41)    
**Speaker 5**:    No worries. Now we knows. Gotta be mobile.  

(23:45)    
**Speaker 3**:    Yeah. I was curious to ask, I dunno if Patrick could answer, because I was really fascinated by the concept of decentralized employment organization and how this new entities will compete. I know this is more a Opolis thing, but if you also know something about it and yeah, 

(24:12)    
**Speaker 6**:    I can share from what I know for Opolis, their whole ideology is more of a, more of a cooperative based approach where they want to keep, since a lot of the DAO legal structure is still up in the air and see which countries are gonna actually allow them to be LLCs or not things like that. There's with all the anonymity that goes on in the space, they're looking at it as why don't we just wrap the individual. So that way they're covered. They're only liable for the contributions that they've made to the DAO, but since their legal wrapped themselves, they should be fine and then create a collective where a bunch of people can all come in and then pull together.  

(25:06)    
**Speaker 6**:    And then that way they're able to get group rate benefits on a larger scale for cheaper premiums. For the healthcare side. That's a little different approach to us, but I do see merit in that if, especially if DAO contributors want to stay anonymous semi-anonymous and want to be able to stay as freelance versus being sent being to just one or two THS, they want to have that lifestyle. It's more of a lifestyle approach in my opinion. That answers your question.  

(25:50)    
**Speaker 3**:    Yep. Yep. Thank you, Patrick. Super interesting. Would like to leave the stage to Bianca one, if you wanna ask the following question.  

(25:59)    
**Speaker 0**:    I have a, I have a question. Like let's me, let's make a use case. Can you hear me well before and you, okay, thanks. I contribute to a DAO where I have no benefits nor protection. If I join Opolis or the work DAO, how does the process work?  

(26:25)    
**Speaker 6**:    If you join, Opolis, you'd have to be in the us or Canada. That's the pretty simple answer. I hope Bill's proud of that answer, but for us, we want to contract on the DAO basis. Our approach, a good example for me, for instance, I contributed to six different thousands at one point. However, I still had a full-time job because I live in the, I live in the states. Then when I lived in Korea, there is, there are certain things that I still need to provide in order to make my life easier. It just didn't make sense for me to ever leave my Web two job for Web Three, when in Web two, I'm already getting all the benefits and I don't have to pay for it myself. That was the whole point of me like working was to have those benefits and top of pay.  

(27:23)    
**Speaker 6**:    In work dial specifically, we're looking at more of the DAO should be the ones with their massive treasuries, be able to provide this type of service to their core teams, core team members in order for them to be incentivized, to stay and participate longer. We're seeing, we're seeing some studies done that can, that have direct correlation between and contribut engagement versus non statutory benefits that these larger dials are starting to provide for their core team members. In terms of that's how it would work. If in terms of the onboarding side, if the DAO like we can use like any DAO we could use like Bitcoin, for example, once they do, once they decide that this is something that they wanna provide, still a DAO. They want do a governance proposal and they want keep it open ended for people who might not need it, who want to look at it.  

(28:27)    
**Speaker 6**:    Then once we contract with on the dial level or a sub dial level through a governance proposal, then we'll do a town hall and basically do a Q and a session similar to what we're doing now with all the contributors and then go through their specific jurisdiction because every jurisdiction, whether it's Columbia, Spain, Germany, or France, are all gonna have different requirements that they need to have. Then on top of that, what the DAO wants to provide to their employ and to their contributors, if they don't want to contribute any additional to the benefits side, then it's, it is gonna work the same thing as Opolis. Then the contributor like yourself will still have access to the benefits and still be protected. Just you would have, it would come out, the contributions would come out of your pocket only.  

(29:26)    
**Speaker 0**:    Wow. That was, yeah. Thank you for answering that. That also makes me think about you said there are so many different countries and different tax regimens, different public well welfare systems in Web two. How does this background diversity affect a hyper connected labor market?  

(29:57)    
**Speaker 6**:    It gets a little tricky it does get a little tricky, especially with a lot of different statutory requirements that these countries face. It's a, it's a good thing. I don't think, I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing since like the whole point of this space and AF after COVID hit having the world more interconnected and having such a cross, such a cross collaboration in labor markets. It definitely, it benefits in my opinion, cuz it just helps us as a whole. I don't wanna get too philosophical, but as a whole, it just, it helps people understand what the differences are, whether it's cultural or whether it's different macroeconomic standards in terms of each country and how they go about it really helps understand where people are coming from.  

(30:56)    
**Speaker 6**:    They're there for a reason. Like in the UK there are mandatory pension and national insurance contributions that you have to make versus like India, for example, actually has ed employment training that needs to be, that needs to be mandatory for employers, which is different than other countries. Depending on the country, that's gonna have it what might think it might be. The only downside is employers might look at it as like dials might look at it, I don't know if I want to really hire devs in France or countries that have complex or a lot of statutory requirements. Since we have such a huge opportunity for inclusivity in this space, we should be going above and beyond just the Le just the base minimum requirements to begin with.  

(32:02)    
**Speaker 6**:    Right. We wanna be better than Web two. That way, in my opinion, when we get the next wave, we want to encourage as many people to adopt ation as possible in order to do that, we need to be able to offer not just a base requirements, but way more E even Web two, they hire internationally. They've been doing that for the last 10 years, and it's been normal and they've been offering more than what the statutory requirements are. I don't know if it's that big of a deal, in my opinion, since we should be doing more than the minimum.  

(32:47)    
**Speaker 3**:    Yeah, totally agree on that should be like Web Three. It's all about building a better environment for everybody. Definitely. Yes. Was the reaction, do DAO understand that what's the benefit that they can have offering better condition to their contributors? Are they receptive on what you're offering? Like what are the reactions normally  

(33:20)    
**Speaker 6**:    The reactions. It's more of, if you take a look at the demographic in this space. The people that are building the people that it's such a huge opportunity for a new market for new people that you get a lot of in the us, for example, if you're under 26, you don't need to get your own health insurance you're under your family. The whole thing that older generation different generations have been saying is, oh, when you're young, you don't need healthcare. It doesn't matter. You're not gonna go to the doctor. You like the only thing you have to worry about is, what if I get in an accident? Well, that's like one in like a million chance, you'll do one in like a thousand chance. You'll get it.  

(33:59)    
**Speaker 6**:    It's, don't even worry about that. That's the mindset that people can have and that's normal, whatever space you're in my thing is that once they actually figure out because benefits has always been, that's always been something that's people have been asking for contributors, it's just this without having enough funding, to be able to funding and treasury, to be able to offer that. That's been the question. Once that actually, once we actually present this to these different dials, the feedback or the response is always okay like if the DAO is going to be able to offer this for me, then to incentivize me to do a little extra, more work or little extra, more bounties, or contribute a little more to develop like a version to, of a vault for, from stable, for example, then why not?  

(34:59)    
**Speaker 6**:    DAO is gotta look at DAO, have to DAO are looking at this as a competitive advantage. Like cross collaboration, DAO to DAO collaboration is great, but as this space grows, we gotta be looking at scalability. If you don't wanna scale, that's fine. But the DAOs that want to scale and want to get their communities larger and want their product, want their products to be more diversified. They need talent. Simple as that the biggest issue actually people that have in this space is actually trying to find talent, find devs that have solidity rest experience. So keeping the current core teams there at some point is gonna have to be passed just what the project's working on past that passion has to be things that life compensation is a benefit or is a, something that entices people to contribute more benefits is just gonna be that extra thing. That's how I see it.  

(36:10)    
**Speaker 3**:    Thanks. Definitely a competitive advantage is a big point in attracting like the big talents. Jake, a question for you does work now help like DAO with, let's say small treasuries, smaller treasuries to offer benefits to their contributors as well.  

(36:37)    
**Speaker 1**:     

(36:39)    
**Speaker 3**:    Or your target is just like big DAO.  

(36:44)    
**Speaker 1**:    Our target is any doubt particularly, but obviously bigger doubts tend to have more, shall we say more permanent? And full-time contributors rather than newer, smaller dials. Just through the nature of that, especially early on more of our clients will probably be larger dials. With lots of con contributors that are, they know they're going to be contributing for a extended period of time. Right? Yeah. Most dos any DAO already  

(37:24)    
**Speaker 6**:    To add on Jake's point, we're seeing a huge movement in the smaller THWs because the time of the larger dos already doing this is pretty much at an end. So now we're starting to shift towards, we're starting to see a shift towards smaller DAO that have smaller treasuries to look at this as an opportunity to start competing and be able to provide this to their contributors as well.  

(37:59)    
**Speaker 3**:    Thanks Juan. I know you would like to ask a question.  

(38:06)    
**Speaker 7**:    Sure. Well, I wanted to ask on the end user of a contributor, for example, I know that there's a lot of people that to stay off the grid and there's a lot of somehow like accept skepticism to how the nation state systems are adopting Web Three within their jurisdictions. How do you deal with that paradox of the fear of Web Three contributor, maybe like getting inside of the loop of the nation state system or how do you protect that user it's anonymity and it's and it's data from maybe things that could be like constraints for participation from a policy of a nation state system.  

(39:25)    
**Speaker 6**:    I can answer that,, to begin. What is your biggest concern on that end besides is it just the data and security or what other things, what is the real concern here when trying to basically interact with these nation states?  

(39:54)    
**Speaker 7**:    Well, maybe harder policies being then try to be put in place towards the people who work in Web Three projects, or also maybe losing anonymity. That's something that sometimes people also appreciate in the decentralized world  

(40:27)    
**Speaker 6**:    To that. I love my anonymity too, when I was contributing as well. It felt great, but I feel like that's this becomes a little more of a,, point of view on the world. If the one hand it's difficult, cuz the one hand, if we want to scale, if we want dos to scale and want more mass adoption, then like how are we able to do that without ever crossing paths with the law, with the real world. Unfortunately the real world still ha is run by a set of rules that are just not gonna go away. They might change.  the biggest fear is even for myself, is, what changes will be made here? We're already looking at the scrutiny that they're putting on like tornado cash is a huge example.  

(41:31)    
**Speaker 6**:    Also like they're starting to look at stable coins then what's next DeFi is next and NFTs are next. When are the next in these states Wyoming has been much more lenient in countries like Estonia, Switzerland, Singapore, they have been much more lenient on DAO structures. That's still up in the air on what we, on what we see in terms of what the legal structure is gonna look like and what they're going to be scrutinizing, but for now O like Opolis and us, same way we have to play nice with them, you know? What, so as long as we just make sure there is no real world consequences, then after that, then we can be flexible. Before then there is only a certain point where we can do that. I understand the anonymity portion of it, but unfortunately healthcare, when comes to healthcare, you ha like you're gonna have to use an health insurance provider and just that's. In terms of a broker, if you look at the other perspective, they're not gonna wanna ensure someone, they have no information over. Right. Then it just becomes the option of whether you want to just pay everything out of pocket or just be able to provide the bare minimum amount of information.  

(43:05)    
**Speaker 1**:    Yeah, just on that as well, just adding to that. If you're a contributor in a DAO, you want to keep your online anonymous, then you can do that. Right. You it's just you that we need to know about if we're offering benefits to people. It's not necessarily your online profile that we need to know to get you, to get somebody compensated and provide them benefits. You don't necessarily have to tie the two together. Right. You can still have a online anonymity without and get benefits and extra things. Right?  

(43:45)    
**Speaker 6**:     

(43:47)    
**Speaker 7**:    Well, that was an amazing answer. We are getting to the top of the hour of this space and I really liked how it's wrapped up because that was one of the most also common questions that people can make. Yeah, I would like to thank you for coming to this space and also that we are sorry for the small technical inconveniences that we had at the start also, thanks to the audience, but I want to wrap also giving you the space to let us know what's next on your radar and how can people learn more from you and interact with you and

Did I miss anything there? PK? Did you wanna add anything?  

(45:12)    
**Speaker 6**:    On the product side, things on our roadmap is we're, we're starting to partner with education, learn to earn platforms, to be able to provide education reimbursement for developers, for non-technical sorts, to be able to get bootcamp training. If it's a dev for Web two that wants to join Web Three or get contribute to DAO, but doesn't know code for solidity arrest, we're starting to partner with those type of providers. That way DAO can offer that to their contributors, part of their onboarding process. We're also already doing one-on-one check-ins and mental health check-ins for these individual contributors on a weekly basis. We are ramping up more providers and partnerships for that project.

Definitely just to add something about what Patrick said most of the fact that you offer training and HR services, mental health check coaching is absolutely amazing.
