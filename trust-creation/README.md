## Ethical Standards and requirements for Gravitons

- **Voluntary Process**: All members in the Gravity group and its cases participate without coercion from any actor.
- **Self-Determination**: The Graviton has agency to lead the conflict management process and facilitate communication, but cannot influence on the potential agreement or the specific outcomes of a dispute.
- **Conflict of interest**: Gravitons can express when they are not capable of facilitating a conversation for any possible reason, personal or professional.
- **Competence**: As we are a community of experts, the mediator, besides being trained in Alternative Dispute Resolution, should be able to prove deep understanding of the specific topics that the dispute may be about, or call for help to SMEs.
- **Confidentiality**: Information related to these processes should be handled privately, and strategically shared only with the agreement by the parties. Unwanted information filtered by the mediator is a reason to remove from the Gravity group.
- **Impartiality and neutrality**: The Gravity group members should lead by their example of empathy and acceptance of different points of view, with freedom from favouritism.
- **Professional Responsibility**: Gravity members should assume the task of mediating in the organization with diplomacy and prudence.
- **Rotation**: Two times a year, new trainings and selection processes will be run to encourage members of the community to become part of the Gravity team. We promote rotation in the roles and management of cases to avoid accumulation of power.

### Gravitons shall be able to:
- Make an effort to be present and accessible to the community, bringing high vibes and improving relationships, bringing the community together.
- Separate the people from problems. Making parties identify with themselves and the other as equals, rather than centering on their own conflictive thoughts-feelings.
- Self-determinate from all parties and recognize key management points by analyzing the information gathered.
- Promote empathy between conflicting parties with emotional intelligence. Building proximity from the abstraction of the problem and the humanization of apparent antithesis.
- Adapt their mindset for tolerance to conflictive situations, keeping calm and diplomacy to stand as an independent third party.
- Propose alternatives to deal with paradoxes while looking for the coexistence and attraction of opposites.
- Act according to institutional regulations while implementing actions to frame unwanted behavior within rules and boundaries (Terms & conditions / Codes of conduct / Graduated sanctions)

## CREATING A SAFE SPACE

### Empathy is the key

Empathy is necessary to be able to apply certain principles of negotiation, as: 
- Separate people from problems 
- Ease communication between conflicting parties
- Focus in interest and not in positions 
- Generate variety of alternative paths to propose solutions
- Use objective or “credibly neutral” criteria to generate legitimacy and impartiality

Empathy brings us together and helps us to take rational and pacific decisions, because individuals who feels underappreciated or ignored are more prone to fall in irrationality just to defend themselves.

## HELPING PEOPLE TO GET TO THEIR OPTIMAL AROUSAL ZONE

<h3>First actions from the mediator:</h3>
<p>Build confidence, Allow expression, letting steam off, listening carefully, taking notes, asking key questions, identifying feelings, careful language, not trying to influence in any particular idea, just being there to understand the other.</p>

## The four components of NVC

**NVC - OFNR process**
### OFNR:
- Make **OBSERVATIONS** without evaluations
- Identifying and expressing **FEELINGS** while taking responsibility for them.
- Uncover the fundamental **NEEDS** triggering the parties, moving the conversation to basic levels of human understanding.
- **REQUEST** That Which Would Enrich Life,  instead of making demands.

## No difference between legitimacy of social law and other types of law.

Following the principles of self governance and self sovereignty, despite the lack of central authorities, we can rely on the social acceptance of internal contracts to create binding procedures, as a basis for participation inside the community.

The point of these processes[k][l] (to have clear roles in the organization played by a group of people accountable of managing the disputes sent to the system, by periodically applying and reviewing transformational actions, and conflict management scaling protocols for complex problems) are to be able to have antifragile systems that set guidelines for resisting frictions in human interaction. 

## Making rules is not just blindly following a system.

To monitor the system’s stability, there must be a clear definition of who are the individuals accountable for managing disputes and promoting the ethical values of the organization in decision taking, rewards and reasonable graduated sanction designs. This group is responsible for developing trust between members, and it’s decisions, or members can be revoked if the majority of the community approves a proposal stating it’s contradiction to social agreements. 

## Correcting contradictory social law behavior

Sanctions are a necessary evil. In order to play exciting games, there must be fast responses to unwanted behavior that can help to easily address common issues and keep playing without much traumatism (like in sports). 


\*I suggest that after a certain time[m][n], accumulated sanctions are erased.

* Light sanctions serve as verbal warnings -to actions that affected other game players without intention to do so, and take place for the first times. 
* Medium sanctions  serve as yellow cards -that are tracked for intentional harm, and the registry of continuing unwanted behavior for a period of time. (duration 6 months)
* Hard sanctions serve as “red cards” that can be called for suspension of privileges of a member through a period of time, for hardly endangering others wellbeing (with or without intention), and persistent unwanted behavior with medium sanctions -This could include removing cstk tokens, banning from community calls, request for external arbitrage and traditional legal actions[o]. (duration from 1 year to 2 years)

## Promoting strategic nonviolent communication

Even though transparency is an ethical value inside the organization, there is no need for making all disputes public. Instead, all conflict management processes should start [p][q]private [r][s]and begin including actors in the conversation by strategic need. 

I suggest the queries can be sent to a bot or a typeform, that is associated to a spreadsheet with a distribution figure that assigns cases equally to each conflict manager so that just sending a message connects you to someone able to manage the situation, lift information about the issue from the parts involved, and suggest sanctions according to the tiers, or help scaling the conflit if it becomes complex to address. This could serve as a database of disputes that can be periodically reviewed to update tiers by nurturing from the insights generated of conflict management practices and unpredicted social behavior. (Also if the person that receives a query declares himself unable to handle the query, they can skip this case and then the dispute is assigned with the distribution figure to another person) -Ex. My brother is involved in a case.
