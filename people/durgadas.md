# My Relationship with Conflict

> What I have learned from him as a person that has a Masters in Conflict Management is that sometimes we focus on addressing conflict when it arises, but it's also very important to prevent conflict and to understand that the conflicts are, are not an expression of duality, but also an expression of our inner self - JuanC

**Durgadas**:    My relationship with conflict, this is a discussion that Juan and I had just before coming into this training, just to talk a little bit about.. we are a group of people coming together to promote the resilience in the decentralized organization. 

> The idea is that I'm trying to bring to the table as a way to address conflict both within yourself and then within the community, then in the larger context of all the different communities you might be connecting with

I'm sure that decentralized organizations and communities have certain social sectors, which are different from let's say corporations and other things. We need to have some unified approach to that. 

My initial proposition to you, **I'm gonna explain this conflict resolution in three stages.** I'll tell you about myself and how I have addressed conflict _within myself_. 

Then the second part is how I went from my own inner conflicts to dealing with those in my relationships, both _with society_ as a whole, and within my _individual relationships_. 

Then I'll give a "theory of everything"  to contextualize, we find ourselves in different conflictual situations in a very large context. Speaking for myself, I'm somebody who is 52 years old. 

### Individual
I'm a lifelong second generation geek who grew up playing hangman on a punch card mainframe. My dad was a computer programmer for a Cobal programmer for Citibank.  

I've literally been in tech since I was probably six years old. More than that, being on the autism spectrum and not learning about it until I was in my forties meant that I had a lot of conflict in my life because I was constantly bullied for thinking differently and behaving differently according to society. 

Eventually I had a bit of an crisis and gave up everything I owned and went and lived in an ashram trying to become a swami. 

I basically spent a long time (as far as spiral dynamics colors, this is my green period) where I went into a community, except it was an Ashram that was like an intentional community.

Not a digital intentional community like this one, but more like a place where we all live together. I got to understand for myself a lot better. 

### Societal

Then, then I started trying to figure out what it is that I needed to do within society and how to address my relationship with society. But I didn't really know enough about myself.

> What we're gonna actually talk today with respect to this community is to combine the models of _non-violence_ / _compassionate communication_ with _spiral dynamics_. 
> 
> Later on, we'll evolve into some other theories of transformational conflict, why is it that we're doing all this, with respect to how to create good boundaries and expectations and other things. 
> 
> All of this relates also back to Ostrom's principles in particular four or five and six, if you're familiar with our work.  

This is all actually to be credited to the folks who started all this, that we were gonna do this cultural build to start with, because it is so valuable to have a real understanding behind everything that we're doing. 

I'm hoping that this contextualizing information can help you personally, within the conflict that we all tend to have it in each each person, and then how to manage conflicts interpersonally, and then to see the approach that the overall community is taking toward the creation of trust. 

Then the back side of that around the creation of trust is often what do we do when those boundaries and expectations are not met and how do we deal with them? So I hope that's a decent introduction for me.  

One further thing I'll say is once I left the ashram, I founded a couple of nonviolent communication groups, and I'm also participating weekly spiral dynamics meeting on Wednesdays at 5:00 PM. There'll be links to that in the, that I've put into the presentation.
