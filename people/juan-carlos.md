**Juan Carlos**:
I am going to start telling a bit about myself. I studied two years of philosophy and then I moved to political sciences and then I started specialization in sustainable development, then in environmental law. Then I study a Masters in conflict management. 

I am very passionate of studying conflict and I have found it to be something that can be applied in our everyday life and in our organizations.

**Juan Carlos**:  I want to share with you like my personal experience. I had a restaurant like five years ago and the restaurant was going good. But I felt that if I stood, like with that restaurant, I wasn't going to like, achieve all of my goals. When I decided to close that restaurant, it was a big conflict for me because I decided it to start doing other, other things.

**Juan Carlos**:    And I didn't have like that economical sustain that the restaurant gave me. It was really hard for me, but right now I can see that conflict that I had as a gift, because that has brought me to enter into the academic world in universities, and also to be entering here in this, in, in this, the community.
