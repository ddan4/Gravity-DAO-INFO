Welcome to those of you who are pinging in just now, I'm Loie. I have been really interested in conflict resolution since I was a teenager, really. Back when I was about 19, I got involved with a restorative justice group in Seattle and actually was able to help found the first restorative justice organization in my city, where we took cases of young adults out of the criminal justice system and offered them to divert into this process. 

That's essentially more like a healing talking circle and that was super valuable experience for me and ever since I started studying and working with them in my community, I became known as a conflict resolution person and my community called upon me in some pretty intense ways to draft up accountability processes. 

I ended up traveling up and down the west coast for some of the conflicts that I was dealing with gathering case notes and connecting victims. Conflict resolution has always been really important to me. 

It comes from my family systems as well. As a child being a smoother over of things. I'm a mediator and yeah, this is just a super big part of my heart and my life and what I offer to the world. I feel like I'm just constantly learning about it and there's no way to really ever become an expert.
