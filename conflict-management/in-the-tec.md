# Conflict management in the TEC

## Guideline for scale of conflicts and graduated sanctions

#### Framework for studying conflicts and suggest appropriate actions to correct unwanted behavior.
* **Small scale conflicts**: The issue involves few people
* **Mid scale conflicts**: The issue is private but is latent in the community
* **Big scale conflicts**: The issue is public and manifest in the community

#### Suggested actions per management mechanism (graduated sanctions)
##### Self compositives:
* **Negotiation**: The conflict manager (graviton) can act as a witness for an issue that is handled directly between parties.
* **Mediation**: The Graviton acts as a facilitator for the conflict management process, helping to identify key points to reach an agreement, but not directly suggesting a solution.
* **Conciliation**: The conflict manager (Graviton) proposes and helps to implement a suggested solution that should be taken into consideration for approval between parties.

##### Heterocompositive:
* **Arbitrage**: An external point of view is needed to address the issue

Here is the guide for studying the conflict, serves us to suggest appropriate actions, to correct the unwanted behavior and a list of ingredients to identify when a conflict is in a mid scale conflict, trying to propose certain actions for each scale of sanctions guideline. 

You can see that the actions are like follow up. Most of the time nothing happens can be settled with, and this is like a signature that I am to make. Is that after every dispute, we can make a small reconciliation between the parts where both of them can like forgive themselves and forgive the other.

Say: "I'm sorry." Say: "thank you," for all the learnings that come from the conflict. "I love you." Love is recognize the other person as an equal and recognize the person values. 

Here we love set circles. Maybe if a member is feeling that he or she is being like pointed out or judged, maybe we can instead of making him or her like, feel more judge, we can start like swarming the conflict with good intentions. 

With people that help to heal, also we can as assign a graviton to gather information for involved parts, and we can have a private conversation between parts.  

The idea of these graduated sanctions is not to impose like sanctions and to punish people. But instead of that, the idea is that according to the issue, we can have a strategic responses to promote healing and wellbeing for the community and for the members. 

Also, we are promoting confidentiality, because I think that is a very key important part of the success of any mediation process. 

Yes, by framing the conflict be between small meetings and big scale conflict, we can also suggest these mechanisms that are the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms that we are going to offer as an organization.

As a group, we can offer negotiation. We can offer negotiation. That is just for an issue that is handled directly between parts. We can have a mediation that is that the Graviton facilitator for the conflict. 

it's the self composite alternative dispute solution that we can offer is like finishes when we have to look for training organization to address the issue. 

This is something that I want to explain better with this, with this graph. 

## Conflict Managment for the TEC (Draft)

The idea that we can have an internal management layer that offers self-compositive alternative dispute solution. That the conflicts that arise within our organization can be settled within, within our internal layer and that they don't go into the exterior management. 

If a conflict is really big, then it's strategically good to request for an external management player and to go to a hetero compositive arbitrage or litigation. 

Our idea is to try to avoid arbitrage and arbitration and try to avoid including external actors to solve our, our own issues and try to solve our own issues internally first and only request if it is actually fit for the, for the better management of the problem. 

What I am trying to express in this, in this process tries to be like this internal management layer tries to provide this internal management layer. 

If we didn't have gravity, maybe a conflict can go to the outside, but the idea is that we can have a previous process where, where if the thing is small, we can handle it. Respond fast within the organization, and only request for arbitration and mitigation if we don't have the tools to manage that conflict internally. 

The idea is that when a conflict happens, it, goes through our internal management and we have our internal follow up, and we have our observation of the conflict, and we make our own insights and we make our own agreement. 

If they don't work, we go to we to review our graduated sanctions and our framework for analyzing and for identifying the conflict so that they can better respond to the conflicts that may arise in the organization.
