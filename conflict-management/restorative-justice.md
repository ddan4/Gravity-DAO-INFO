# Restorative Justice

**e) [Restorative Justice Circles](https://oscr.umich.edu/article/restorative-justice-circles)**

Restorative Justice Circles (“Circles”) provide an opportunity for community members to come together to address harmful behavior in a process that explores harms and needs, obligations, and necessary engagement. 

**Who’s involved?**

* **Responsible Parties** — the individuals whose actions have harmed others and/or the community
* **Impacted Parties** — those who were directly harmed by the respondents’ actions
* **Affected Parties** — others who consider themselves or their community to have been harmed by the actions of the respondents
* **Supporting Parties** — friends or family of either the respondents or the affected parties
* **Facilitators** — training OSCR staff who facilitate the Circle
